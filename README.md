### FAQ

### How can I add usage tracking?

This repository includes support for Google Analytics or [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io), but, by default, this is disabled.

To enable Google Analytics:

- Create a Google Analytics 4 property and obtain the measurement ID (of the format `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)
- In [.env](.env), add `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX`

Keep in mind that your region might have legislation about obtaining a user's consent before enabling trackers. This is up to downstream repos to implement.

To enable Plausible Analytics:

- Create a new website with Plausible Analytics with a given domain, e.g. `example.app`
- In [.env](.env), add `REACT_APP_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN=example.app`
